# Project: Nostromo Terminal UI

## 1. Application Overview

*   **Application Name:** Nostromo Terminal UI
*   **Core Concept:** A retro-futuristic terminal interface for the spaceship Nostromo, with the look and feel of the computer screens from the 1979 movie *Alien*.

## 2. Key Features

### 2.1. Visual Style

*   **CRT Effect:** Monochromatic display (green or amber text on a black background) with scan lines and screen flicker simulation.
*   **Font:** Blocky, monospace, pixelated font to emulate the retro aesthetic.
*   **Interaction:** Keyboard-only interaction, with no mouse support.

### 2.2. Functionality

*   **Boot-up Sequence:** A simulated boot-up sequence with system checks and loading messages.
*   **Main Menu:** A central navigation hub to access different system modules.
*   **System Modules:**
    *   **Crew Roster:** Displays a list of crew members, their roles, and statuses.
    *   **Ship Status:** Shows the status of various ship systems (e.g., Life Support, Engines, Communications).
    *   **Navigation:** A text-based representation of the ship's course and destination.
    *   **Self-Destruct Sequence:** A multi-step self-destruct activation with warnings and a countdown timer.
    *   **Log Entry Viewer:** A simple text viewer for simulated ship logs.

## 3. Self-Destruct Sequence

The self-destruct sequence is activated by typing `DESTRUCT` in the main menu. You will be prompted to confirm your choice and then enter a secret activation code.

**Secret Activation Code:** `MUTHUR`
